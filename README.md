# jd-comment-remover
A command-line tool that **removes comments** from **decompiled .java files** generated by the [Java Decompiler Project, JD-GUI](hteetps://java-decompiler.github.io/).

It will automatically **skip non-Java files**, or **Java files** that already **lack comments**.

I wrote this last week while at work, and updated it last second today, so the only code I have is an older copy.

I will provide the current source code later, or... ironically, you can use the decompiler and just decompile the [provided .jar file](https://github.com/ViveTheModder/jd-comment-remover/releases).

Out of whatever respect I have left, I have censored the name of the tool that was decompiled, although I can assure you that certain hispanic BT3 modders already got a hold of it through abnormal means, given that it is close-source and not pubicly released.

Also, **this tool does not encourage any unethical use of decompiling.** It is only supposed to facilitate another tool, where that responsibility falls under.
